The reason popular Engines like Yahoo or DuckDuckGo haven't been mentioned yet is because Google is a trendsetter and anything shared by Google has to be incorporated by everyone to maintain consistency. Mastering one, can help you master all.

## Tricks, Tips & Secrets :secret:
|S.No.|Tip / Trick|
|----|-----|
|1.|Make a twitter account and add all details asked by them. Twitter has bots and that helps you get trending. They also have good SEO. |
|2.|LinkedIn also gets you trending and pushes posts through hashtags.|
|3.|Twitter caption limits (280 characters).|
|4.|Use hashtags. Not too many to look like spam but just enough. 5-6 hashtags per post is fine. #100DaysOfCode & #CodeNewbie are good to use for everything.|
|5.|Don’t use same word more than 5 times in your web page or Google will mark it spam. Not always but keep repetitions around 5.|
|6.|Google Ads- monitor, experiment and change.|
|7.|Image names & Video names should be what you want it to be shown on Google for. Example: Akshat_Gupta_WebDeveloper.png (everywhere including social handles and websites).|
|8.|Link all social profiles (Insta, FB, LinkedIn, Google, Twitter).|
|9.|Use Google Search Console to put your sitemap on Google Crawler and hence apply to get your website indexed and shown on Google.|
|10.|Sitemaps are basically descriptions of when a page was created and what it has.|
|11.|Add meta tags.|
|12.|Pay to promote on FB not Insta. Since Facebook is the parent company, it promotes on Insta for free.|
|13.|Editing posts reduces reach.|
|14.|Share on Facebook and other options also reduce reach. Do it individually. (Insta has share to FB option. Don’t use it).|
|15.|YouTube has new algo changes. Pushing businesses which are active rather than popular. Use the right hashtags and descriptions and be active.|
|16.|Make a Wikipedia account for yourself and make an article on yourself.|
|17.|Star repos and fork repos on GitHub. More of these your repo has, more famous it is.|
|18.|Be regular and try to interact more on social media.|
|19.|Write blogs as much as possible.|
